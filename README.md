# MRI Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning
This project implements a CNN–Transformer hybrid deep learning architecture to classify brain tumors from MRI scans. The CNN component extracts rich spatial features from medical images, while the Transformer captures global contextual relationships to improve classification performance. The model automatically categorizes MRI images into multiple brain tumor types, supporting efficient and accurate medical image analysis and diagnosis assistance.
## Problem Statement
Brain tumor diagnosis using MRI scans is time-consuming and requires expert radiologists. This project aims to automate brain tumor classification using deep learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.
